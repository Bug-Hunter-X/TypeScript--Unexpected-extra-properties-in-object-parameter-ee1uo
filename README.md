This example demonstrates a common issue in TypeScript related to object parameter types.  The `printCoord` function expects an object with `x` and `y` properties. However, TypeScript doesn't throw an error if you pass an object with additional properties. This can mask potential issues in larger applications.

The solution demonstrates how to use optional properties or interfaces to handle cases with extra properties more robustly.
